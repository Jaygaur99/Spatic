# Spatic task

## Installation

1. [OPTIONAL] Create a python virtual environment

2. Run command:

   `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the script in the following format:

   `python scripts.py <input_file> <output_file>`

   The file should be a csv file (the code written is according to a csv file)

To get help about the script, type:

`python script.py -h`

**The script will slow start but will speed up as the time goes due to the way the code is written.**
